        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I’m Naveen, a passionate developer and creative thinker focused on building purposeful digital experiences.
            I see development not just as writing code, but as designing systems that grow, evolve, and solve meaningful problems.

            I have hands-on experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, developing projects such as a self-ordering tablet system for restaurants.
            Through this, I strengthened my understanding of UI structure, user interaction flow, and clean front-end architecture.

            Beyond web development, I’m deeply invested in game development and system design. 
            I study core development principles — mechanics, progression systems, balance, and world-building.
